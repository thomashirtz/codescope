# ðŸ’» `codescope`

## Overview
`codescope` is a Python tool that creates a comprehensive summary of a Python project. It's designed for developers, teams, and even Language Learning Models (LLMs) who want to quickly understand the structure and contents of a new or existing Python project. The tool can be particularly useful for LLMs to quickly have context for a conversation about a codebase. It analyzes the project structure, including its files and directories, and extracts key information such as functions, classes, and their respective docstrings.

## Features
- **Project Overview**: Includes content from the project's README.md.
- **File Tree Structure**: Generates a tree view of the project's file structure.
- **Functions and Classes Summary**: Lists all functions and classes in the project, with the option to include docstrings.
- **Command-Line Interface**: An easy-to-use CLI for generating project summaries.

## Installation
To install codescope, you will need Python installed on your system. Then, codescope can be easily installed using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/thomashirtz/codescope#egg=codescope
```

This command will install the latest version of codescope directly from the GitHub repository. Once installed, you can utilize the application via the command line using `codescope` or `cs`.

## Usage
The tool is used via the command line with various flags to customize the output:

Positional Arguments:
- `project_path`: Path to the Python project (optional, defaults to the current directory if not specified).

Optional Flags:
- `-o`, `--output-filepath`: Specify the output file path.
- `-r`, `--readme`: Include project markdown (README.md) in the summary.
- `-i`, `--inspection`: Include inspection of functions and classes.
- `-d`, `--docstrings`: Include docstrings of functions and classes (only valid if inspection is activated).
- `-f`, `--full-content`: Include the full content of all files in the project in the summary.
- `-cb`, `--clipboard`: Copy the summary to the clipboard.
