    Generates a visual tree structure of the file system starting from the specified path.

    This function traverses the directory tree starting from the given path, creating
    a string representation of the directory and file structure. It allows for configurable
    indentation and the option to include or exclude files in the output.

        indent_size (int): The size of the indentation for each level of the tree (default is 4).

        str: A string representation of the tree structure of the file system.
