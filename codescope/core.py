    Compiles a detailed summary of a Python project from various components.

    This function creates a unified summary string from selected components of a project,

    The inclusion of each component is controlled by boolean flags.

    Args:
        project_path (str): Path to the root of the project directory.
        include_tree (bool): Include file tree structure in the summary if True.
        include_inspection (bool): Include a summary of functions and classes if True.
        include_readme (bool): Include README.md content if True.
        include_docstrings (bool): Include docstrings in the summary of functions and classes if True. Relevant only if include_inspection is True.
        include_context_prompt (bool): Include a context prompt at the beginning of the summary if True.
        include_full_file_content (bool): Include full file contents in the summary if True.

    Returns:
